`nexume` is a simple and static resume template using [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).

## Getting started

You can run the dev server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and start editing by modifying src/app/page.tsx. Next.js will auto-update as you edit the file.

-----

## Deploying your app

Most hosting platforms allow you to define `build` command and `output` folder:

- Build command: `npm run build` or `next build`
- Output folder: `out`

> Make sure your hosting platform options are the same as above.
